Greetings, code breaker.

This computer will randomly pick a 4 letter passcode from the 
letters ABCDEF (multiples of the same letter may be possible). 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, will be to crack 
this code.

You will be given 8 attempts. After each attempt, you will be 
given 2 pieces of information:

  1) the number of letters that are in the correct position.
  2) the number of letters that are correct, but in the wrong 
     position.

After 8 attempts, you will be locked out of the system, and it 
will be GAME OVER.

Good luck!
