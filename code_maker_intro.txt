Greetings, code maker.

You will be need to create a secure 4 letter passcode from the 
letters ABCDEF. The computer will help you test the strength of 
your passcode by attempting to break it.

The computer will be given 4 tries. After each attempt, it will
be given 2 pieces of information:

  1) the number of letters that are in the correct position.
  2) the number of letters that are correct, but in the wrong 
    position.

After 4 attempts, the computer will be locked out of the system,
and you will be congradulated on coming up with a secure passcode!

Good luck!
